# gr4-block-tutorial

This repo is designed to show how to create simple blocks in GR4

## Setup and build



```
cd gr4-block-tutorial
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/code ghcr.io/mormj/gr4-oot-env:latest bash # this defaults to the /code directory
meson setup build
cd build
ninja
ninja test
```

For convenience this repository also contains a vscode devcontainer that points to this docker image


### Why do we use meson in this repo?

Mainly, because it's easier to work with than CMake and doesn't need to match what the rest of GR4 uses, since that is "packaged" and installed in the container. Meson lowers the bar for build system understanding since the purpose of this tutorial is to learn the basics of writing blocks.  


## GR3 Flowgraphs
For testing we will be pushing samples and packets to and from GNU Radio 3.x using ZMQ push and pull blocks.  The supporting flowgraphs are contained in the gr3_grc folder.  The `gr4-oot-env` container contains some basic ZMQ blocks and a PMT converter for GR4 from `github.com/gnuradio/gr4-incubator` which is the proving ground for future official blocks

### ZMQ Streaming

`zmq_streaming_signal.grc` sends out a source of complex samples from a ZMQ Push Sink (which will be recieved by the GR4 flowgraph). The expected return is a stream of complex samples.

### ZMQ Packets
`zmq_packet_signal_loopback.grc` sends out a source of complex samples from a ZMQ Push Sink (which will be recieved by the GR4 flowgraph).  The expected return are PMT vectors of complex samples.

## OOT Structure

This structure is subject to change, but for now all blocks will live in `blocks/tutorial/include/gnuradio-4.0/tutorial`

Example flowgraphs will live in `blocks/tutorial/examples`

QA tests will live in `blocks/tutorial/test/`

## Lesson 1:  Our first block

### Creating the block

Create a new file under `[ROOT]/blocks/tutorial/include/gnuradio-4.0/tutorial` called `Square.hpp`

Let's go ahead and code the most basic of blocks


```c++
#pragma once

#include <gnuradio-4.0/Block.hpp>
#include <gnuradio-4.0/BlockRegistry.hpp>


namespace gr::tutorial {

struct Square : Block<Square> {

    using Description = Doc<"@brief Squares the input value">;

    PortIn<float> in;
    PortOut<float> out;

    GR_MAKE_REFLECTABLE(Square, in, out);

    [[nodiscard]] constexpr float processOne(float input) const noexcept { return input*input; }
};

} // namespace gr::tutorial


GR_REGISTER_BLOCK(gr::tutorial::Square, [ float, short, std::complex<float> ])
```

### What should we notice:

1) Curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP)

Block is declared as derived from type `Block` with template parameter `Square`.  This design pattern allows the framework to use concrete type (Square) to generate metadata, default behaviors, and connect the scheduler hooks.

2) Docs are baked in

The `Description` statement can be used at compilation to automatically generate docs 

3) Ports

In GR4, ports are a first class type, and are defined at compile time strongly typed.  This is a key difference between GR3 and GR4 where in GR3 the ports are very general buffers of `void *` data.  

4) Reflection

A convenience macro takes in all the elements of the block that should be registered (ports, parameters) with the reflection system.  This will allow runtime changes to parameter via PMTs without further coding in the simplest cases

5) New ways of doing work

For this block, the simplest (and most preferred) method for defining the `work` that the block does - the `processOne` function.  This can only be used for block constructions that are single input, single output, non-decimating or interpolating.  But it allows the compiler to build this into higher loops that better match the scheduling or optimization constraints.

```c++
[[nodiscard]] constexpr float processOne(float input) const noexcept { return input*input; }
```

`constexpr` - enables compile-time evaluation when possible; also signals triviality.
`noexcept` - promises not to throw (lets the scheduler stay lean).
`[[nodiscard]]` - catches mistakes if someone calls it and ignores the result.

This method takes in one `float` input value, and returns one `float` output value.  Because it is pure & stateless â†’ easy to reason about, test, and parallelize.  This will allow the runtime to:
  - pipeline across threads
  - fuse it with adjacent ops (merge API)
  - vectorize it trivially


6) Plugin Registration

We will go into more detail about this later, but basically this is a statement that is ignored by the compiler (the macro is empty), but used by postprocessing tools to code generate runtime wrappers for strongly typed instantiations of this block


### Using this in a flowgraph

In the `examples` folder, there is a file called `zmq_loopback.cpp` that receives the ZMQ stream from GR3, runs it through a `Copy` block, then sends it back.  Let's go ahead and see this behavior, then we'll copy over the flowgraph to a new file, swap out for our block and work from there.

The zmq_loopback application should already be build from when we ran `ninja` before

```
cd build
./blocks/tutorial/examples/zmq_loopback
```

While this is running, our flowgraph is waiting for samples from GR3.  Run the zmq_packet_signal_loopback.grc flowgraph and you will see live samples coming back to the QT Time Sync:

![zmq streaming flowgraph](images/zmq_streaming.png)

Ctrl-c the GR4 running flowgraph and you will notice that it kills the stream in GR3.  This is now our baseline for demonstrating GR4 flowgraphs

Copy `zmq_loopback.cpp` to `zmq_loopback_square.cpp`.  We need to replace the `Copy` block with our `Square` block.  The code should look like this:

```c++

int main() {

 
    using T = float;

    gr::Graph fg;
    auto&     source = fg.emplaceBlock<gr::zeromq::ZmqPullSource<T>>({
        {"endpoint", "tcp://localhost:5555"},
        {"timeout", 10},
        {"bind", false},
    });

    auto& sink = fg.emplaceBlock<gr::zeromq::ZmqPushSink<T>>({
        {"endpoint", "tcp://localhost:5556"},
        {"timeout", 100},
        {"bind", true},
    });

    auto& squareBlock = fg.emplaceBlock<Square>({
    });


    const char* connection_error = "connection_error";

    // if (fg.connect<"out">(source).to<"in">(sink) != gr::ConnectionResult::SUCCESS) {
    //     throw gr::exception(connection_error);
    // }
    if (fg.connect<"out">(source).to<"in">(squareBlock) != gr::ConnectionResult::SUCCESS) {
        throw gr::exception(connection_error);
    }
    if (fg.connect<"out">(squareBlock).to<"in">(sink) != gr::ConnectionResult::SUCCESS) {
        throw gr::exception(connection_error);
    }


    gr::scheduler::Simple<gr::scheduler::ExecutionPolicy::singleThreaded> sched{std::move(fg)};
    const auto                                                            ret = sched.runAndWait();
    if (!ret.has_value()) {
        std::print("scheduler error: {}", ret.error());
        std::exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}


```

Also, we need to create the executable - update `meson.build` to make a separate executable for the `Square` version of the zmq loopback

```meson
exe = executable('zmq_loopback_square', 'zmq_loopback_square.cpp',
  install : true,
  include_directories: inc_dirs,
  dependencies: [gr4_dep, gr4_blocklib_dep, pmt_conv_dep, zmq_dep, gr4_zeromq_headers])
```

Compile this with `ninja`, then run `zmq_loopback_square` from the command line.  You will also need to modify the GRC flowgraph to send floats since that is what we hardcoded in the Square block.


## Lesson 2:  Templates

For many blocks, it is necessary to allow it to work over a variety of types.  C++ uses templates to achieve this purpose, so we will update the `Square` block to achieve this purpose
